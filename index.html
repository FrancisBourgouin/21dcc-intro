						<h3>The situation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's say we have a friend that needs to account for every tree in Montréal, and they are describing each tree using some repetitive copy and pasting...
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters, 45 years old. The tree looks like 🌳 and is indigenous to Canada.</p>
						<p>1 pine tree that measures 12.6 meters, 65 years old. The tree looks like 🌲 and is indigenous to Canada.</p>
						<p>1 palm tree that measures 5.6 meters, 25 years old. The tree looks like 🌴 and is not indigenous to Canada.</p>
						<p>And so on...</p>						
					</section>
					<section>
						Pretty boring no?
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Since all entries are and will look the same, it's possible for us to approach the problem in a programatical way.</p>

							What is JavaScript?
						</p>
						<p>
							JavaScript is an interpreted language where either a browser or specific software, like Node.js, will execute.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Where does it come from?
						<ul>
							<li>JavaScript is a language developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, to add interactivity to the browser. (Remember Netscape?)</li>
							<li>Microsoft implemented a reverse-engineered version called JScript for Internet Explorer in 1996, which led to support issues between IE and other browsers.</li>
							<li>A standardized version of JavaScript (ECMAScript) was officialized 1997.</li>
							<li>In early 2009 ECMAScript 5 was adopted and disparities between browsers was officially over.</li>
							<li>ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, is the version most widely used by everyone right now.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						What does it looks like?
						Executing <pre><code class="js">console.log("Hi there!");</code></pre>
						Will output <pre><code class="js">=> Hi there!</code></pre>

						<h3>Analysing the situation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						We know that every entry will look the same, let's isolate what will be different.
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's find what's different:
						<ul>
							<li>1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters, 45 years old. The tree looks like 🌳 and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 pine tree that measures 12.6 meters, 65 years old. The tree looks like 🌲 and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 palm tree that measures 5.6 meters, 25 years old. The tree looks like 🌴 and is not indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Highlighted, we see the isolated elements that are different:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 oak</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">10.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">45</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">🌳</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 pine</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">12.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">65</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">🌲</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 palm</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">5.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">25</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">🌴</span> and <span class="inverted">is not</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at what this line contains: 
						<p><span class="inverted">1 oak tree</span> that measures <span class="inverted">10.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">45</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">🌳</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the number (integer) 1, representing the quantity during the observation.</li>
							<li>the name (string) oak, representing the type of tree.</li>
							<li>the number (float) 10.6, representing the height of the tree in meters.</li>
							<li>the number (integer) 45, representing the age of the tree.</li>

						<h3>Wait... What are those float, integers, strings and booleans?!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In JavaScript we have data types like float, integer, booleans, strings and others.</p>
						<p>Let's start with the basics of a string.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at how one entry would look like in JavaScript.
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Initial-string?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
						We can use quotes ('), double quotes (") or backticks (`) to specify that what is coming is a string.
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We can also store that string so we can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Manipulate it</li>
							<li>Copy it</li>
							<li>Or reference to it at a later date</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It will look like this:</p>
						<pre><code class="js">let specificEntry = `1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters...`</code></pre> 
						<ul>
							<li>We use the keyword let to declare a variable.</li>
							<li>You may see variable declarations with const and var.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It will look like this:</p>
						<pre><code class="js">let specificEntry = `1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters...`</code></pre> 
						<ul>
							<li>We name it, in this case specificEntry.</li>
							<li>This way of writing is called camelCase, which is a common way of writing variables names in JS.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It will look like this:</p>
						<pre><code class="js">let specificEntry = `1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters...`</code></pre> 
						<ul>
							<li>Using the equality sign, we assign the string to it.</li>
							<li>An equal sign in JavaScript means assignement, not comparison!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Executing it will be like this: </p>
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/String-with-var?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>			
						<p>Note that each instruction should end with a semicolon.</p>

						Great!

				</section>

				<section class="createvariables">
					<section>
						<h3>Let's create some variables!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Based on what we had in the entry:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the number (integer) 1, representing the quantity during the observation.</li>
							<li>the name (string) oak, representing the type of tree.</li>
							<li>the number (float) 10.6, representing the height of the tree in meters.</li>
							<li>the number (integer) 45, representing the age of the tree.</li>
							<li>the emoji (string) 🌳, representing the look of the tree.</li>
							<li>the fact (boolean) is, representing the fact that it is indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In a variable form:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="inline-code"><pre><code class="js">let treeAmount = 1</code></pre>, representing the quantity during the observation.</li>
							<li class="inline-code"><pre><code class="js">let treeType = `oak`</code></pre>, representing the type of tree.</li>
							<li class="inline-code"><pre><code class="js">let treeHeight = 10.6</code></pre>, representing the height of the tree in meters.</li>

							<li class="inline-code"><pre><code class="js">let treeIsIndigenous = true</code></pre>, representing the fact that it is indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Talk about what each variable type can contain
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						So, now that we have a string variable for the entry and multiple variables for our changing elements, can we merge those?

				</section>

				<section class="variablesyntax">
					<section>
						<h3>Variable syntax & manipulation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Before going further with our entries, let's look at what we can do with variables.
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We have two different kinds of numbers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integers, also known as round numbers, like ...,-1,0,1,2,3... </li>
							<li>Floats, numbers that have a decimal point, like 3.14, -6.28</li>
						</ul>
						<p>No need for quotes around numbers!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>For numbers, we can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Add: 1 + 1</li>
							<li>Substract: 1 - 1</li>
							<li>Multiply: 1 * 1</li>
							<li>Divide: 1 / 1</li>
							<li>And more!</li>
						</ul>	
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We assign numbers to variables like this:</p>
						<pre><code class="js">let someRoundNumber = 437;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let someFloatNumber = 3.1415926535;</code></pre>
					</section>	
					<section>
						<p>We can put whatever we want in strings:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Letters, words & sentences, like 'j', 'Hello' & 'Hey buddy!'</li>
							<li>Numbers, like '1234', '2.718', '1 4 6 7'</li>
							<li>Emojis, like '😎', '🤦‍', '🤷‍'</li>
						</ul>							
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>WARNING!</h3>
						<p>As long as there are quotes, doublequotes or backticks, it will be considered a string!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Since strings are not numbers, we can't use substract, divide or multiply operations directly.</p>	
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>However, we can add strings together, also known as concatenation.</p>
						<pre><code class="js">"Hello" + "There"</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">=> "HelloThere"</code></pre>

					</section>
					<section>
						We assign strings to variables like this:
						<pre><code class="js">let salutation = 'Hello!';</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let someStringWithNumbers = '3.1415926535'; //this is a string now</code></pre> 
						<pre><code class="js">let someStringWithDoubleQuotes = "Hey!";</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let someStringWithBackticks = `Good morning!`;</code></pre>
					</section>						
					<section>
						With the newer syntax of JavaScript and backticks, we can insert the value of a variable directly inside a string!
					</section>
					<section>
							Using the newer syntax of JavaScript: 

						<pre><code class="js">let name = 'Francis';</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let personalizedSalutation = `Hi ${name}!`;</code></pre>
							Instead of the older way:
						<pre><code class="js">let name = 'Francis';</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let personalizedSalutation = 'Hello ' + name + '!';</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's have a look at our entry, in a JavaScript way:
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeAmount = 1;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeType = `oak`;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeHeight = 10.6;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeAge = 45;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeEmoji = `🌳`;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeIsIndigenous = true;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let specificEntry = `${treeAmount} ${treeType} tree that measures ${treeHeight} meters, ${treeAge} years old. The tree looks like ${treeEmoji} and ${treeIsIndigenous} indigenous to Canada.</code><pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's see the output:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Listofvariablesforoneentry?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						Why did we make our entry variable more complicated than before?
					</section>
					
				</section>

				<section class="reusability">
					<section>
						<h3>Reusability</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						We can now change the values outside the strings:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Listofvariablesforoneentry?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						We can also change the names of variables:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Listofvariablesforoneentryv2?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						Now that we isolated the variable from the static content, we can create a lot of variables to feed the string with content.
					</section>
					<section>
						However...
					</section>
					<section>
						It is A LOT of variables.
					</section>					
				</section>

				<section class="wrangle1">
					<section>
						<h3>How to wrangle multiple variables</h3>
						<h3>Part I</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						All of our variables are needed for one tree:
						<pre><code class="js">let treeAmount = 1;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeType = `oak`;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeHeight = 10.6;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeAge = 45;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeEmoji = `🌳`;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let treeIsIndigenous = true;</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						If only there was a way to create a variable containing multiple properties...
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Objects!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Objects are a type of variable that are a little bit more special.</p>
						<p>They contain data with a key:value pairing system.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						In this object, we have the keys 'key', 'coolness' and 'color'.
						<pre><code class="js">let someObject = {key:value, coolness:9001, color:"blue"}</code></pre>
						'value', '9001' and 'blue' are the values associated to those keys.
					</section>
					<section>
						We could then create an object containing all of the properties of one tree:
<pre><code class="js">let specificTree = {
  amount: 1,
  type: `oak`,
  height:10.6,
  age:45,
  emoji:`🌳`,
  isIndigenous:true
}
</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						We access the data inside an object using this notation:
						Name of the object, name of the property, separated by a dot.
						<pre><code class="js">specificTree.amount</code></pre>
						Name of the object, name of the property in square brackets.
						<pre><code class="js">specificTree[`amount`]</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at an updated version of our script:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Listofvariablesforoneentryv3?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						Now that our data for one tree is grouped up together, we have one last problem for our variable proliferation.
					</section>
					<section>
						We still need one variable per tree, which is still a lot.
					</section>
					
				</section>
				
				<section class="wrangle2">
					<section>
						<h3>How to wrangle multiple variables</h3>
						<h3>Part II</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Would it be possible to make an object containing all of our tree objects?
					</section>
					<section>
						It would be, but there is something better to group independent elements.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>arrays!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Arrays are a type of variable that are a little bit special too.</p>
						<p>They contain data with a index:value pairing system</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							In this array, the string 'hello' is it's second element.
							<pre><code class="js">let someArray = [1234, 'hello', name, true]</code></pre>
							It's important to know that indexes in arrays starts at 0. What is the index of 'hello'?
						</section>
						
					<section>
						Let's add two of our objects to an array.
<pre><code class="js">let specificTree = {
	amount: 1,
	type: `oak`,
	height:10.6,
	age:45,
	emoji:`🌳`,
	isIndigenous:true
};
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="js">let anotherSpecificTree = {
	amount: 1,
	type: `maple`,
	height:4.6,
	age:85,
	emoji:`🌳`,
	isIndigenous:true
};
</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let listOfTrees = [specificTree, anotherSpecificTree];</code></pre>

					</section>
					<section>
						We access the data inside an array using the name of the object, index in square brackets.
						<pre><code class="js">listOfTrees[0]</code></pre>
						Don't forget that indexes starts at 0, not 1!
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's play with those objects in the array: 
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/arraysandobjects?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						Now our data is well organized, but we still need a fair share of copy & paste.
					</section>					
				</section>

				<section class="comparisons">
					<section>
						<h3>Comparisons & conditions</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						For the eagle-eyed, you saw that in an entry we have a small problem.
						<pre><code class="js">"...and true indigenous to Canada."</code></pre>
						Should be 'is indigenous', not 'true indigenous'.
					</section>
					<section>
						That is because the data type for our indigenous variable is a boolean.
					</section>
					<section>
						A boolean variable has either true, or false as a value like this:
						<pre><code class="js">let beTrue = true;</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">let beFalse = false;</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We can assign a boolean value to a variable.</p>
						<p>We can also get a boolean out of a comparison between values.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						We can compare using:
						<pre><code class="js">1 === 1   // True, Equal & identic</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">1 == '1'  // True, Equivalent</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">1 !== '1' // True, Equivalent value, but different type</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">1 != '1'  // False, Equivalent</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">1 > 10    // False, 1 is not bigger, also >= for bigger or equals</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="js">5 < 6     // True, 5 is smaller, also <= for smaller or equals</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Since we can now compare, it means we can make conditions.
						"If the tree is indigenous to Canada, return the string 'is', if no, return 'is not'".
					</section>
					<section>
						In code form:
						<pre><code class="js">
let isOrIsNot = "";
if (specificTree.isIndigenous) {
	isOrIsNot = "is";
} else {
	isOrIsNot = "is not";
}
						</code></pre>
						the value will then adjust itself based on the result of the condition.

					</section>
					<section>
						Let's play with it a little bit:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/ifstatement?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						What if we don't want to write a conditional statement for each tree?
					</section>
				</section>

				<section class="functions">
					<section>
						<h3>Encapsulating instructions in functions</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Our previous conditional statement wasn't that long, but again, we will need to write it over and over.
					</section>
					<section>
						With functions, we can execute multiple operations:
						<pre><code class="js">
// Declaring the function
const someFunction = function(){
	console.log("Hey!");
	console.log("Ho!");
	console.log("Let's go!");
};

// Calling the function
someFunction();
						</code></pre>
					will output:
						<pre><code class="js">
=> Hey!
=> Ho!
=> Let's go!
						</code></pre>					
					</section>
					<section>
						We can also ask the function to return a value:
						<pre><code class="js">
// Declaring the function
const someOtherFunction = function(){
	let a = 20;
	let b = 30;

	return a + b;
};

// Calling the function
let result = someOtherFunction();

console.log(result)
						</code></pre>
					will output:
						<pre><code class="js">
=> 50
						</code></pre>
					</section>	
					<section>
						We can also ask the function to take a parameter:
						<pre><code class="js">
// Declaring the function
const someOtherFunction = function(someParameter){
	let a = 20;
	let b = 30;

	return a + b + someParameter;
};

// Calling the function & storing the return value in result
let result = someOtherFunction(50);

console.log(result)
						</code></pre>
						will output:
						<pre><code class="js">
=> 100
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>So how about our conditional statement?</p>
						<pre><code class="js">
let specificTree = {
	amount: 1,
	type: `oak`,
	height:10.6,
	age:45,
	emoji:`🌳`,
	isIndigenous:true
};
							</code></pre>
						<p>To make the condition, we need to know the value of isIndigenous.</p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Why not give the entire object to the function?</p>

						Let's play with functions:

					</section>

						Now let's try to create a function that will output the entire entry

					</section>
					<section>
						What if we could execute the function over and over?
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>automate your life with loops!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>With the function we made, we can output one entry.</p>
						<p>But we still need to execute the function one at a time.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Loops are very useful for two things:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To repeat an instruction a lot of times.</li>
							<li>To repeat an instruction for a yet undefined amount of times.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						This is how a standard for loop looks and operate:
						<pre><code class="js">
for (let iterator = 0; iterator < amountOfTimes; iterator++) {
	// Do something
}
						</code></pre>
						If we were to read that in plain english, it would be like:
						<p>"For the value of my iterator that starts at 0, as long as it's smaller than amountOfTimes, increment by one my iterator"</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The condition can be anything, as long as it's not causing an infinite loop!
						<pre><code class="js">
for (let iterator = 0; iterator < amountOfTimes; iterator++) {
	// Do something
}
						</code></pre>
						By using the .length method, we can know how many elements there is in an array!
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at what it would look like with our previous work:
						<pre><code class="js">let listOfTrees = [specificTree, anotherSpecificTree];

const isItIndigenous = function(treeObject) {
	//...
	return isOrIsNot
}
const showEntry = function(treeObject) {
	//...
	console.log(textEntry)
}
for (let iterator = 0; iterator < listOfTrees.length; iterator++) {
	showEntry(listOfTrees[iterator])
}						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's see it in execution:
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/forloopcomplete?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
					</section>
					<section>
						We can now create a function containing our for loop, and we will be done!
						<pre><code class="js">let listOfTrees = [specificTree, anotherSpecificTree];
const isItIndigenous = function(treeObject) {
	//...
	return isOrIsNot
}
const showEntry = function(treeObject) {
	//...
	console.log(textEntry)
}
const showAllEntries = function(listOfTrees){
	for (let index = 0; index < listOfTrees.length; index++) {
		showEntry(listOfTrees[iterator])
	}
}						</code></pre>
