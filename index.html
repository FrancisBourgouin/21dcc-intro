						Having a situation to help us put in context what we are about to do always help, so we'll talk about...

						<h1>Trees !</h1>

						<h3>Mise en situation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's say we have a friend that needs to account for every tree in MontrÃ©al, and they are describing each tree using some cut & paste-fu...
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters, 45 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ³ and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 pine tree that measures 12.6 meters, 65 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ² and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 palm tree that measures 5.6 meters, 25 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ´ and is not indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Pretty boring no ?
					</section>
					<section>
						Since all entries are and will look the same, it's possible for us to approach the problem in a programatical way.
						Coding will be pretty helpful for us here.
					</section>
				</section>

						<h3>What is coding ?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Coding is all about giving the simplest set of instructions to a computer so that a language, like JavaScript that we will use today, will be able to interpret and execute.
					</section>
					<section>
						So how do we use coding to help us with the current problem ?
					</section>

						<h3>Analysing the situation</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						We know that every entry will look the same, let's isolate what will be different.
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's find what's different :
						<ul>
							<li>1 oak tree that measures 10.6 meters, 45 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ³ and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 pine tree that measures 12.6 meters, 65 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ² and is indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li>1 palm tree that measures 5.6 meters, 25 years old. The tree looks like ðŸŒ´ and is not indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Highlighted, we see the isolated elements that are different :
						<ul>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 oak</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">10.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">45</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">ðŸŒ³</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 pine</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">12.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">65</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">ðŸŒ²</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
							<li><span class="inverted">1 palm</span> tree that measures <span class="inverted">5.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">25</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">ðŸŒ´</span> and <span class="inverted">is not</span> indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at what this line contains : 
						<p><span class="inverted">1 oak tree</span> that measures <span class="inverted">10.6</span> meters, <span class="inverted">45</span> years old. The tree looks like <span class="inverted">ðŸŒ³</span> and <span class="inverted">is</span> indigenous to Canada.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the number (integer) 1, representing the quantity during the observation</li>
							<li>the name (string) oak, representing the type of tree</li>
							<li>the number (float) 10.6, representing the height of the tree in meters</li>
							<li>the number (integer) 45, representing the age of the tree</li>
							<li>the emoji (string) ðŸŒ³, representing the look of the tree</li>
							<li>the fact (boolean) is, representing the fact that it is indigenous to Canada.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Wait... What are those float, integers, strings and booleans terms ?!</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						In JavaScript we have data types, like float int bool string and others
						its important because they have different kind of actions that can be taken on them
					</section>
					<section>
						Let's look at how one entry would look like in JavaScript
						<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@FrancisBourgoui/Initial-string?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
						We can use quotes ('word'), double quotes ("word") or backticks (`word`)to specify that what is coming is a string
